## 1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
    Answer: 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
    The best way to automate testing would be to have it automatically run when a code is pushed. 
    This way, we don't have to manually check our code and it saves a lot of work, feeding into the "automated" portion of the description.

## 2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
    No. End to end testing is more about testing user actions. Its purpose is not to test individual functions but to test how users interact with the web page as whole.
